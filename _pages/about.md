## About Me
I am currently a PhD student co-supervised by [Prof. Michael Backes](https://cispa.de/en/people/backes) and [Prof. Franziska Boenisch](https://franziska-boenisch.de/) at CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security. Before joining CISPA, I worked as a research assistant on hardware and microarchitectural security of machine learning accelerators (FPGA, GPUs, etc.), following Prof. Xiaolin Xu at the University of Illinois in Chicago and Northeastern University in Boston. I received my bachelor’s degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2017 and my master’s degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from George Washington University, Washington D.C., USA in 2019.
