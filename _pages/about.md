## About Me
I am currently a Ph.D. co-supervised by [Prof. Michael Backes](https://cispa.de/en/people/backes) and [Dr. Yang Zhang](https://yangzhangalmo.github.io/) at CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security. I received my bachelor's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2017 and my master's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at George Washington University, Washington D.C., the USA in 2019. After that, I worked as a research assistant following with Prof. Xiaolin Xu in University of Illinois in Chicago and Northeastern University in Boston. I used to doing research on hardware security and microarchitectural security in machine learning accelerators (FPGA, GPUs, etc.).
