## About Me
I am currently a Ph.D. co-supervised by Prof. Michael Backes and Dr. Yang Zhang at CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security. I received my bachelor’s degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2017 and my master’s degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from George Washington University, Washington D.C., USA in 2019. After that, I worked as a research assistant following Prof. Xiaolin Xu at the University of Illinois in Chicago and Northeastern University in Boston. I used to do research on hardware security and microarchitectural security in machine learning accelerators (FPGA, GPUs, etc.).

## Research Interests
Trustworthy Machine Learning (data security and privacy protection)
